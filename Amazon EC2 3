ðŸ”¹ Elastic Block Store (EBS)
Attached to EC2 like a virtual disk

Types:

gp3 (General Purpose SSD â€“ default)

io2 (Provisioned IOPS SSD)

sc1/st1 (Cold/Throughput HDD for low-cost storage)

Snapshots: backup of EBS volumes to S3

ðŸ”¹ Security Groups
Acts like a firewall

Rules allow traffic only (no deny)

Stateless â†’ need to open inbound and outbound rules

Example rule: Allow SSH from your IP â†’ Port 22, Source: your.ip.address/32

CPU utilization

Disk I/O

Network traffic

Can set alarms and auto-recovery actions

ðŸ”¹ Auto Scaling & Load Balancing
Auto Scaling: Automatically adds/removes instances based on demand

Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances
