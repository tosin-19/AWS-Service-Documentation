Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service from AWS that provides resizable virtual servers, called instances, in the cloud. These servers allow you to run applications without owning physical hardware.

ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts
Term	Description
Instance	A virtual server in EC2 used to run applications.
AMI (Amazon Machine Image)	A template containing the OS, application server, and applications.
Instance Type	Defines the hardware (CPU, memory, storage) for the instance. E.g., t2.micro, m5.large.
EBS (Elastic Block Store)	Persistent block storage volumes for EC2.
Key Pair	Used for SSH access (public/private key).
Security Group	Acts like a virtual firewall, controlling inbound/outbound traffic.
Elastic IP	Static public IPv4 address that you can allocate to an instance.
User Data	Script or commands that run when an instance starts (used for bootstrapping).
